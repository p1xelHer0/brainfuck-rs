# brainfuck-rs

Dumb simple [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) implementation in Rust.

## [The Epistle to the Implementors.](http://www.brainfuck.org/epistle.html)

## [Here are some little programs for testing `brainfuck` implementations.](http://www.brainfuck.org/tests.b)

I don't know a lot of Rust but I know more Rust than I did before writing this. Success! ðŸŽ‰

## TODO

- ~~Read user input with the `,` operator~~ - Should work?
- `stdin`/`stdout`
- Feature creep
  - `REPL` style input, show live `output`
  - `CLI` functionality
  - Read input from file
  - Implement `Display` and `Error` trait
